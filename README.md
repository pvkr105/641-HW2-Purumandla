## **TECHINICAL BACKGROUND**
I completed my Undergraduate in Computer Science Engineering in 2020. I have done my major project on Data Analytics. Currently pursuing Master at Grand Valley State University in Applied Computer Science.


## **PROJECTS**
 - **Predictive Maintenance**

we build an LSTM network for the data set and scenerio described at Predictive Maintenance Template to predict remaining useful life of aircraft engines. In summary, the template uses simulated aircraft sensor values to predict when an aircraft engine will fail in the future so that maintenance can be planned in advance.Describing the dataset The dataset consists of sensor readings from a fleet of simulated aircraft gas turbine engines operating conditions as a multiple multivariate time series. The dataset consists of separate training and test sets. The testset is similar to the training set, except that each engine’s measurements are truncated some (unknown) amount of time before it fails. The data is provided as a ZIP-compressed text file with 26 columns of numbers. Each row represents a snapshot of data taken during a single operational cycle and each column represents a different variable.

I did this project as my Major Project. You can find the documentation too in the repository.

This project is also published in Kaggle with additional step by step information and comments. https://www.kaggle.com/vamshikreddy/predictive-maintenance-using-lstm

Thanks to https://github.com/umbertogriffo/Predictive-Maintenance-using-LSTM for the code.

  - **E-Commerce Website - Django**

This Web Development project deals with developing an E-commerce Website. It provides the user with a list of the different products available for purchase in the online store.A shopping cart is provided. After the products are selected, it is sent for the order confirmation. The system is implemented using Python’s web framework Django and SQLite Database which comes with the framework.

The website will display products, customers can browse the catalog and select products, customer can remove products from their cart specifying the quantity of each item. Selected items will be stored in a cart. At checkout, the items in the cart will be presented as an order. Customers can pay for the items in the cart through a payment portal to complete the order. The project also provides security with the use of login ID and passwords, so that no unauthorized users can access your account. Only authorized person with access authority can access the software.
